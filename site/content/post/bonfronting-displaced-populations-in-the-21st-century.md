I'm working with the Innovation Service at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on imagining a better future for refugees.

We're meeting with migration experts to better understand the challenges confronting displaced populations in the 21st century.

In collaboration with the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, I worked with scientists, policy makers, and artists to envision better energy futures. Our short story will be featured in the coming volume Cities of Light.
