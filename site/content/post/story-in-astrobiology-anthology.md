My short story "This is How We Save Them", about trophy hunting on another planet, was published in the collection Life Beyond Us from the European Astrobiology Institute. In the story I ask ethical questions about growing animals for the sake of sport and the bizarre practice of funding trophy hunting to protect conservation areas. It's set on a distant moon. But if it sounds like what happens today on Earth - whether with bighorn antelope or lions - it should.

Erik Persson wrote the insightful response essay to my story. Like other collections the brilliant Julie Novakova has done, she pairs original fiction with scholarly essays that elucidate the themes in the stories. It's a formula I love! The collection also features work from Malka Older, Tobias S. Buckell, and many others. Thank you to Lukas K. Law for his editing.
