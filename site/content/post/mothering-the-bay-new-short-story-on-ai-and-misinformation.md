How can we prepare for an age of misinformation and AI? That was the theme of a dinner I attended at UC Berkeley's [College of Computing, Data Science & Society](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/), which was co-hosted by Arizona State University's [Center for Science and the Imagination](https://csi.asu.edu/). "Mothering the Bay" is my depiction of the heady themes we discussed that evening at the UC Berkeley Faculty Club. I translated the wide-ranging discussion into a 6000 word short story depicting a mother and daughter crossing the San Francisco Bay on the subway (the BART) - when a terrifying disaster strikes. 

**Babe Liberman** wrote a brilliant [nonfiction response essay](https://issues.org/futuretensefiction/ai-literacy-babe-liberman/) to my story based on her knowledge of how AI is impacting teaching and pedagogy. It's worth a read. Rey Velasquez Sagual create the beautiful digital art. 

A special thank you to **Andres Martinez** and **Mia Armstrong-LÃ³pez** for editing the story.
